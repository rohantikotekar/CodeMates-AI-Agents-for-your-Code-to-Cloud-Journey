## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The CodeMates platform operates as a distributed AI agent system where each agent specializes in specific DevOps domains:

- A **Code Analysis Agent** (reviews, suggests improvements, detects issues)
- A **Build Prediction Engine** (forecasts success rates, identifies risks)
- A **Pipeline Orchestration Service** (manages CI/CD workflows automatically)
- A **Infrastructure Management Layer** (handles Docker, cloud resources)
- A **Communication Hub** (natural language processing for user interactions)

This ensures a comprehensive and intelligent approach to DevOps automation, from code commit to production deployment.
